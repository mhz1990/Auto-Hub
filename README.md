## Sales microservice

My approach is to begin by creating models for the data. Next, I'll create view functions then urls which will then allow us to interact with the database and crud data as required. After this is complete, I'll create the logic for the polling service. Then I'll begin working on the front-end logic in order to populate data in the React site.
